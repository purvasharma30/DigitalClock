<p id="description">The provided code is a Python script that uses the tkinter library to create a graphical digital clock application. The code sets up a user interface with a large stylized digital clock display and it continuously updates the displayed time in "Hour:Minute:Second" format. Users can interact with the graphical clock and the application window is resizable. The clock's appearance is customized with a specific font background color foreground color and border width. The code achieves real-time time updates by employing the time module and the after method to refresh the clock display every 200 milliseconds. This allows the digital clock to run as an interactive desktop application providing a visual representation of the current time.</p>

<h2>üõ†Ô∏è Installation Steps:</h2>

<p>1. Ensure You Have Python Installed: Ensure that you have Python installed on your system. You can download the latest version of Python from the official Python website: python.org/downloads.</p>

<p>2. Check if Tkinter is Installed: Tkinter is included with most Python installations so you typically don't need to install it separately. You can check if it's available by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:</p>

```
python -m tkinter
```

<p>3. Create a Python File: Copy the provided Python code into a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE).</p>

<p>4. Run the Python Script: Save the file with a .py extension and then execute it from your terminal or command prompt:</p>

```
python your_file_name.py
```

<p>5. Interact with the Digital Clock: After running the script the digital clock window will appear. You can interact with it and the time will update in real-time.</p>
